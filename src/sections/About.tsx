          Hi, I&apos;m Haneen
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-600">
          I am a coach, facilitator and teacher conducting one-on-one coaching
          and courses in communication & conflict. I developed my integrative
          approach over the last 5 years, and have taught hundreds of people.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-600">
          I help employees uproot unhelpful communication patterns that cause
          conflict avoidance, micro-management, resentment and demotivation. And
          transform this into a heart-led culture that brings more efficiency
          and psychological safety into the workplace.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-600">
          Most communication courses are all about a technique and focus on what
          to say or how to say it. But this misses a crucial first step: to
          develop a stronger relationship to your feelings and how you treat
          them. From there, you&apos;ll be able to understand what you need from
          a co-worker or supervisor and deliver this kindly & directly, rather
          than abrasively or tacitly.
        </p>
